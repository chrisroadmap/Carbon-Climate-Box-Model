Data to run the example script.

These are postprocessed data from raw output of MPIESM-LR-v1.2 emission-driven simulations. Some of the metrics, like the atmospheric CO2 concentration are not 100% precise (e.g. for CO2 it is the concentration in the lowest atmosphere level and not the mean over the whole atmosphere).

At some point, these data should be replaced with properly processed data from the cmorized and published MPIESM output on ESGF, which, however, are not available yet.
